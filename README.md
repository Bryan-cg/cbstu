# The Constrained Bottleneck Spanning Tree Problem with Upgrades (CBSTU)

ðŸš§ Under construction ðŸš§

Existing algorithms that solve the Constrained Bottleneck Spanning Tree Problem (CBST) are implemented and converted to solve the CBSTU:
- [The Constrained Bottleneck problem in Networks](https://www-jstor-org.kuleuven.e-bronnen.be/stable/171309#metadata_info_tab_contents) Berman et al. 
- [An Improved Algorithm for the Constrained Bottleneck Spanning Tree Problem](https://pubsonline-informs-org.kuleuven.e-bronnen.be/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.8.1.41) by Punnen & Nair

Problem tailored Edge Elimination algorithm provides fastest performance. Calculating lower and upperbound beforehand is the bottleneck in the Punnen algorithm, so we avoid calculating bounds beforehand and use a binary search combined with updating the working graph (eliminating edges) to increase performance.
